## Results summary

* The model demonstrates <span style="color: green;">**7% improvement**</span> over the baseline heuristic algorithm
* This translates to over <span style="color: green;">**$4 000 000 of savings**</span> on the budget required for the initiative implementation
* After iterating the model over different budget amounts and looking at budget vs. performance sensitivity, <span style="color: green;">**$60 000 000 is an optimal budget**</span> that maximizes overall profit
