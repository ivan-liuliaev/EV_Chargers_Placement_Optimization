# Georgia public EV chargers placement optimization 🔮

![](assets/20241129_183434_Untitled_design-2.jpg)

## Results summary

* The model demonstrates **7% improvement** over the baseline heuristic algorithm
* This translates to over **$4 000 000 of savings** on the budget required for the initiative implementation
* After iterating the model over different budget amounts and looking at budget vs. performance sensitivity, **$60 000 000 is an optimal budget** that maximizes overall profit
